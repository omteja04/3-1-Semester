## Explain various Blind Search Strategies in Artificial Intelligence

> Don't focus much on advantages and disadvantages.

Blind search strategies, also known as uninformed search strategies, are search algorithms used in Artificial Intelligence that explore the search space without any domain-specific knowledge. They are called "blind" because they do not use any information about the goal or the distance to the goal other than what is provided by the problem definition. Here are some common blind search strategies:

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

Here’s an overview of DFS:

1. **Traversal Order**: DFS starts at the root (or any arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It goes deep before going wide.
2. **Stack Usage**: DFS uses a stack (either explicitly or via recursion) to remember which vertices to visit next.
3. **Completeness**: DFS is generally not complete for infinite graphs or graphs with loops, as it can get stuck in a loop.
4. **Optimality**: DFS does not guarantee that it will find the shortest path to a goal.
5. **Time and Space Complexity**: The time complexity of DFS is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. The space complexity depends on the implementation, a recursive implementation can have a O(h) space complexity [worst-case], where h is the maximal depth of your tree.

**Example:**
In the below search tree, we have shown the flow of depth-first search, and it will follow the order as:

Root node &rarr; Left node &rarr; right node.

It will start searching from root node S, and traverse A, then B, then D and E, after traversing E, it will backtrack the tree as E has no other successor and still goal node is not found. After backtracking it will traverse node C and then G, and here it will terminate as it found goal node.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

Here’s an overview of BFS:

1.  **Traversal Order**: BFS starts at the root (or any arbitrary node) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
2.  **Queue Usage**: BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored. It follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
3.  **Completeness**: BFS is complete, meaning that if a solution exists, it will find it.
4.  **Optimality**: BFS is optimal for unweighted graphs, meaning it will find the shortest path to a goal.
5.  **Time and Space Complexity**: The time complexity of BFS is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. The space complexity is O(V) as it needs to store all vertices in the queue.

**Example:**

In the below tree structure, we have shown the traversing of the tree using BFS algorithm from the root node S to goal node K. BFS search algorithm traverse in layers, so it will follow the path which is shown by the dotted arrow, and the traversed path will be:

S &rarr; A &rarr; B &rarr; C &rarr; D &rarr; G &rarr; H &rarr; E &rarr; F &rarr; I &rarr; K

### Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)

Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) is a hybrid search algorithm that combines the benefits of both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). It performs a series of depth-limited DFS, gradually increasing the depth limit in each iteration until the goal is found or all nodes are explored.

Here’s an overview of IDDFS:

1. **Depth Limit**: IDDFS starts with a depth limit of 0 and performs a depth-first search up to that limit. If the goal is not found, the depth limit is increased by 1, and the search is repeated.
2. **Space Efficiency**: Like DFS, IDDFS uses linear space, making it more space-efficient than BFS, especially for large search spaces.
3. **Time Efficiency**: Although IDDFS may seem inefficient because it revisits nodes multiple times, it is often as time-efficient as BFS for uniform tree structures.
4. **Completeness**: IDDFS is complete, meaning it will find a solution if one exists.
5. **Optimality**: In a tree with uniform step costs, IDDFS is optimal, meaning it will find the shortest path to the goal.

**Example**:
Following tree structure is showing the iterative deepening depth-first search. IDDFS algorithm performs various iterations until it does not find the goal node. The iteration performed by the algorithm is given as:

![](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/iterative-deepeningdepth-first-search.png)

Uninformed Search Algorithms
1'st Iteration &rarr; A
2'nd Iteration &rarr; A, B, C
3'rd Iteration &rarr; A, B, D, E, C, F, G
4'th Iteration &rarr; A, B, D, H, I, E, C, F, K, G
In the fourth iteration, the algorithm will find the goal node.

### Bidirectional Search

Bidirectional Search is a search algorithm that runs two simultaneous searches: one forward from the initial state and the other backward from the goal state. The aim is to meet in the middle, reducing the search space and often speeding up the search process.

Here’s an overview of Bidirectional Search:

1. **Two Frontiers**: The algorithm maintains two frontiers, one for the forward search from the start and one for the backward search from the goal.
2. **Meeting Point**: The search continues until there is a common node that appears in both frontiers. This common node is the meeting point, and the path from the start to the goal can be constructed by concatenating the paths from the start to the meeting point and from the meeting point to the goal.
3. **Efficiency**: By searching from both directions, the algorithm can significantly reduce the search space, often leading to faster search times compared to unidirectional methods like BFS or DFS.
4. **Completeness**: Bidirectional Search is complete, meaning it will find a solution if one exists.
5. **Optimality**: If both searches are done using BFS (or a variant that ensures the shortest path), then the solution found will be optimal.

**Example**:

In the below search tree, bidirectional search algorithm is applied. This algorithm divides one graph/tree into two sub-graphs. It starts traversing from node 1 in the forward direction and starts from goal node 16 in the backward direction.

The algorithm terminates at node 9 where two searches meet.

> Ignore UCS

### Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)

Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) is a tree traversal or graph searching algorithm that is a key part of many artificial intelligence applications.

Here’s a brief overview of UCS:

1.  **Principle**: UCS explores paths in the increasing order of cost. It prioritizes nodes based on the cumulative cost from the start node to the current node, ensuring that the paths with the lowest total cost are explored first.
2.  **Data Structure**: UCS typically uses a priority queue to keep track of nodes, where the nodes are prioritized by their path cost from the start node.
3.  **Optimality**: UCS is guaranteed to find the optimal solution if the cost function satisfies the condition of non-negativity. It will explore all paths with cost less than the cost of the optimal path to ensure that the solution found is indeed the best one.
4.  **Completeness**: UCS is complete, meaning that if a solution exists, UCS will find it.
5.  **Time and Space Complexity**: The time and space complexity of UCS can be high, depending on the branching factor and the depth of the optimal solution. It can be inefficient if there are many paths with similar costs.

**Example**:

## Explain Constraint Satisfaction Problem and Solve a Crypto-Arithmetic puzzle (SEND + MORE = MONEY) show the steps involved in finding solution.

### Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)

A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) involves finding values for variables under specific constraints such that all constraints are satisfied. In a CSP, you typically have:

- **Variables**: Elements that need to be assigned values.
- **Domains**: Possible values each variable can take.
- **Constraints**: Rules that define allowable combinations of variable values.

The goal is to assign values to all variables in a way that satisfies all the given constraints. CSPs can be solved using various methods, including backtracking, constraint propagation, and optimization techniques.

### Crypto-Arithmetic Puzzle: SEND + MORE = MONEY

## Prove the theorem infer [(A->B) ^ (B->C)]-> (A->C) using NDS

To prove the theorem **[(A &rarr; B) ^ (B &rarr; C)] &rarr; (A &rarr; C)** using a truth table, follow these steps:

**Create a Truth Table:** Construct a table that includes all possible truth values for the propositions `A`, `B`, `C`, and then calculate the truth values for the compound statements involved in the theorem.

![](https://i.ibb.co/7krgHLb/img8.jpg0)

**Analyze the Results:**

- The column for **[(A &rarr; B) ^ (B &rarr; C)] &rarr; (A &rarr; C)** must be true (T) for all possible truth values of `A`, `B`, `C` in order for the theorem to be proven.

Since the column **[(A &rarr; B) ^ (B &rarr; C)] &rarr; (A &rarr; C)** is true for all possible values of `A`, `B`, `C`, the theorem **[(A &rarr; B) ^ (B &rarr; C)] &rarr; (A &rarr; C)** is proven to be valid using the truth table.
