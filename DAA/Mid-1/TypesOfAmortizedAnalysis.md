1. **Aggregate Method**:

   - **Example**: Buying coffee every day.
   - Suppose you buy a cup of coffee every day for $3, but one day you also buy a coffee machine for $90. Over time, the coffee machine will reduce your daily coffee costs.
   - The **aggregate method** would consider the total cost (coffee + machine) and average it over all days to give an average daily cost. Even though some days (buying the machine) are more expensive, the overall cost per day becomes reasonable over time.

2. **Accounting Method**:

   - **Example**: Prepaid phone plan.
   - Imagine you pay $30 upfront for a phone plan that includes calls, texts, and data. On most days, you may use only a fraction of the service, but some days you make a lot of calls or use more data.
   - The **accounting method** charges you $30, which includes paying for both light and heavy usage days. Your prepaid amount covers those rare heavy usage days, even though you don't use the full amount every day.

3. **Potential Method**:
   - **Example**: Piggy bank for emergency savings.
   - You put a little money into a piggy bank every week, so when an emergency (like a sudden car repair) happens, you can withdraw from it.
   - The **potential method** views your weekly savings as increasing the "potential" or stored resources in your bank. When the emergency happens (a costly operation), you reduce the potential by spending the money, keeping your overall financial situation balanced.
